Create a login and Sign Up page and go to the News home page. After successfully creating a signup page with validation you have to use the same User Id and Password for login. Use Google or Facebook icon to log in and go to the home page directly by using a third-party library or firebase and also add the logout functionality. On the Home page, you have to implement a news API (https://newsapi.org/)
